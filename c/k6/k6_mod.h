/* k6_mod: run a small native module from the K6's RAM, sent over the air.

   A module arrives as whitened L or XL packets with magic 0xAB
   (docs/k6-modules.md). De-whitened, each packet is

     0xAB, transfer id, chunk number, chunk count, data (len - 6 bytes), CRC-16 (big-endian)

   Magic 0xAE instead of 0xAB marks the same packet "reply wanted" (ARQ, images from 2026-11-06
   on): the K6 then answers over the air, on 440.850 MHz only, with 0xAF report packets
   (km_report_status / km_report_text below): which chunks are still missing, 2 s after the
   sender's last packet, and once the module has run, its result and its say lines.

   and the chunks, in order, make the module image:

     0  'K' '6' 'M' 1      magic and ABI major 1
     4  code length        u16, little-endian
     6  entry              u16, byte offset of the entry function in the code (even)
     8  serial             u32, must be newer than the last module this boot accepted
     12 API level, flags   u8 (the k6_api_t level it needs, at most KM_LEVEL), u8 (flags: 0),
                           u8 telemetry parts (0-12: with a reply-wanted upload, the K6 sends
                           this many 0xAF text packets of the module's say lines after it runs),
                           1 reserved byte
     16 code               position-independent Thumb (clang -fropi), no data or bss
     16 + code length      SipHash-2-4 tag (8 bytes, little-endian) of bytes 0 .. 15 + code length
                           under the 16-byte key the library was built with (KM_KEY)

   The chunks land straight in the pager's message store, which the radio then lacks a message
   for: the first chunk of a new transfer empties the store (sp_init with 0 bytes), and the
   caller re-initialises it with sp_init once the transfer is over. Without KM_KEY (the CI
   build) every module is refused.

   The module runs on the caller's stack, once, as int entry(const k6_api_t *api): it reaches
   the radio only through the table. The table is append-only within ABI major 1.
