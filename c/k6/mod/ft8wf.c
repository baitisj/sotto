/* ft8wf: the K6 as an FT8 front end, its waterfall streamed to the host (docs/k6-ft8-wspr.md).

   The whole receiver (ft8rx.c, c/k6/ft8/ft8k.c) is 7 KB of M0 code and needs about 4 KB of
   RAM besides: more than the 4 KB module store and the ~3.5 KB of stack a module has today.
   So this module runs the half that fits: the IF front end (gp0rx.h: GP0 by DMA, the noise-
   filling gain, the real-time mixer, two CICs to about 200 Hz) and ft8k's DFT rows, and sends
   each 80 ms row of FT8_NB 4-bit bins over the serial report. The host decodes them with the
   same ft8k code (tools/k6_ft8.py decode LOG), which also proves the whole RF path on the radio
   before the receiver moves onto the K6.

   Lines (base64 of 2 rows, FT8_NB / 2 bytes each, two bins a byte, low nibble first):
     ft8wf start nb=32 f=1500 inv=0 cal=-16580              (cal: the IF offset the mixer
                                                            follows, 0.01 Hz, from the radio's
                                                            calibration record; 0 for none)
     ft8wf gain rms=4.7 g=03ff rms=9.1 r2=27 ks=5490        (noise rms at the AGC, at the gain)
     w 0 <44 base64 chars>                                  (the first row's number)
     ft8wf st t=15 lost=12 ks=5492 flo=812 idle=60          (every 15 s; idle: % of it spent
                                                            waiting for the DMA)
     ft8wf done rows=3750 lost=180
