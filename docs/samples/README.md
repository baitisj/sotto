# Listening samples

These are 8 kHz, 16-bit FLAC files, written with [HamFLAC](https://github.com/baitisj/hamflac). They were made by `sim/audio_race.py --render` (see `docs/audio-race.md`). Each clip is Codec 2 2400 sent through the C4FM softmodem, a simulated FM channel and the real softmodem receiver.

For each of the three voices there are:

| File suffix | What it is |
|---|---|
| `__original` | the input speech |
| `__codec2_2400_no_channel` | Codec 2 2400 with no radio channel (the best any scheme can do) |
| `__446_MHz_60_kmh_52_dB-Hz__sotto_vw` | sotto in the VW slot, UHF mobile, a fairly weak signal |
| `__446_MHz_60_kmh_52_dB-Hz__dn_conv` | Codec 2 in the DN slot with our convolutional code, same channel |
| `__446_MHz_60_kmh_52_dB-Hz__dn_rep` | Codec 2 in the DN slot with Fusion-style protection (27 bits ×3), same channel |
| `__146_MHz_30_kmh_56_dB-Hz__sotto_vw` | sotto in the VW slot, slow VHF fading (the hard case) |

PESQ for these conditions (mean of 3 fading seeds; the files are from the first seed):

| Voice | No channel | sotto VW, UHF 52 | DN conv, UHF 52 | DN rep, UHF 52 | sotto VW, VHF 56 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Female (LibriSpeech 198) | 2.16 | 1.69 | 1.35 | 1.19 | 1.82 |
| Male (LibriSpeech 3436) | 2.91 | 2.28 | 1.73 | 1.35 | 2.10 |
| Male (ve9qrp) | 2.85 | 2.50 | 1.84 | 1.48 | 1.94 |

## Encoder against encoder (`encoder/`)

`encoder/<voice>__<condition>__codec2_2400.flac` and `...__sotto_v35.flac` are the same voice sent through the identical chain (sotto VW payload, C4FM softmodem, same channel and fading seed, same receiver). Only the encoder and decoder differ. The conditions are no radio channel; 446 MHz, 60 km/h, 52 dB-Hz; and 146 MHz, 30 km/h, 56 dB-Hz. Scores are in `docs/encoder-v1.md`.
